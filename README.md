# A Programming Journey into Types

# About this project
  The idea behind the project is to make an educational platform for studying
  Abstract Algebraic Structures and Properties of different Data Structures,
  Functions, Sets and Types.

# About Coq
  I have chosen Coq[INSERT LINK HERE!!!], as the platform for doing the study.
  Coq is a Proof Assistant, a specialized purpose programming language defined
  purely for reasoning about programs and not creating fast programs. The
  reason for this is because of the way Coq represent its types. For instance
  the natural number 5 is (S (S (S (S (S 0))))), which is really slow to
  calculate with, but easy to reason about. Every thing is well defined
  and we can reason about everything.
